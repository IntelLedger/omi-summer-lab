Welcome to the OMI Summer Lab! This document will get you started with
Hyperledger Sawtooth, a blockchain development platform. Blockchains form the
underlying technology of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and offer
unique capabilities for providing trustworthy copies of data between
potentially adversarial parties.

To support the OMI Summer Lab, the Sawtooth team has built a sample Transaction
Processor and JavaScript client allowing for the representation of musical
Works and Recordings on the blockchain. This documentation will help you get
started running a local instance of Hyperledger Sawtooth with the OMI
transaction processor on your development machine. From there, you can build
apps on top of the JavaScript client in node.js or in a web browser and extend
the sample transaction processor to support new transaction types and data
formats.

To learn more about Hyperledger Sawtooth, you can explore the `documentation
<https://intelledger.github.io>`__.
